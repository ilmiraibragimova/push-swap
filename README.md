# push-swap
Challenge
To produce an algorithm which outputs instructions, to sort data. In this project, we must produce two programs, push_swap and checker. push_swap displays on stdout, instructions to sort data in a stack. checker reads stdin and ensures that instructions are valid, and that they sort the data. The two programs can be used together, see below.

The game is composed of 2 stacks named a and b.
To start with:
a contains a random number of either positive or negative numbers without any duplicates.
b is empty
The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.
To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:
